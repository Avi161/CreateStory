        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            CreateStory was founded with a passion for interactive storytelling. We believe that stories shouldn't be linear – they should adapt, evolve, and respond to choices, just like real life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our platform began as a small project by a group of developers and writers who wanted to create branching narratives without needing to code. Today, we're proud to offer a comprehensive platform that empowers creators of all skill levels to build rich, interactive stories.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            We envision a world where stories transcend traditional media. Where readers become participants, making meaningful choices that shape unique narrative journeys. We're building tools that democratize interactive storytelling, making it accessible to everyone with a story to tell.
        </p>
